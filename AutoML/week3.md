Ingest&Analyze:
- Problem Definition
- Algorithm Selection

Prepare&Transformation:
- Class imbalance: changing your performance metric, applying resampling techniques, generating synthetic data or even changing your selected algorithm, as an example. Xgboost tends to handle class imbalance well, but it also supports additional hyper parameter tuning to further tune for data imbalance
- Train-Validation Splits

Model Training: interative model tuning
