## Feature Engineering
Selection
- Identify: data attributes
- Filter: irrelevant and redundant attributes
  - Reduce feature dimensionality
  - Train models faster

Creation
- Combine: existing data points into new features
- Infer: new attributes
  - Lead to more accurate predictions

Transformation
- Impute: missing feature values
- Scale: numerical features
- Transform: non Numerical features
